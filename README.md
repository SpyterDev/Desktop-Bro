## What is Desktop Bro:
  Desktop Bro is a small little Desktop Pet engine (seriously, it is less than 200 lines of code) written in the Go programming language. 
It actually took less than an hour to write the code but I might also expand the Desktop Bro Player to add more functionaty and improve thing like window movement
